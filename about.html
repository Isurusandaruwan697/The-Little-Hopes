          <p>We started extending help to needy children and youth who were
            eager to study and work for a better life. This moment intensified when 
            we found that there were many such underprivileged children who needed help 
            with food, shelter and education. Our team expanded and we spread out
            in different regions to make sure we cover all possible areas and help
            as many children as possible.
            We now run shelter homes, schools and a reasonable mess that helps such needy young
            people. We also have our helpline offices spread throughout the country so one can 
            approach us anytime they need help.</p>
